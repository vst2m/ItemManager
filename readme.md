# 1. About

This is an Openplanet plugin written for Trackmania. It is used to download and manage itempacks.

# 2. Features

For now, only [TrackmaniaItemsSorted](https://github.com/ski-freak/TrackmaniaItemsSorted) is available for download.<br>
The plugin also has an auto-update feature, whenever a new update to an itempack comes out, the pack will be updated when booting trackmania.

The different modes for how an item pack should be downloaded don't work yet.

# 3. Future plans

This plugin is still in its early stages. Future plans include macroblock pack support, other sets, managing other packs that are not available for download through the plugin, moving items around more easily, ...<br>
Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!

# 4. How it works

You can open the plugins menu by opening up the openplanet menu, go to plugins then Item Manager. A popup window should open.

From there you can download indexed itemsets and different versions of it. There's also a mode selection for what should happen to existing items, but this doesn't do anything and will most likely be changed in the future.

The plugin has a list of indexed itemsets. Only indexed sets are available for download through the plugin.

When downloading a pack, the pack goes into <code>Trackmani/Items/[pack name]/</code>.

Auto-updates delete the previous version and re√Ønstall the latest version of the pack like you would click the download button.
